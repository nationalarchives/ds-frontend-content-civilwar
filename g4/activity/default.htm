<h1>Why did people want the king back in 1646?</h1>
<h1 class="minorheading">Activity</h1>
<h2 id="p1">Part 1</h2>
<p>Historians have always been puzzled about why Charles had so much support in 1646. The best explanation they can come up with is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>People wanted peace and stability. They felt you could not have that without a king. Living through civil war was worse than living under Charles I’s rule.</li>
<li>Rule by Parliament’s County Committees was worse than living under Charles I’s rule.</li>
<li>Many people were suspicious that some Parliament leaders had radical (extreme) and dangerous ideas. People thought that getting Charles back on the throne would stop these radical Parliament leaders.</li>
</ul>
<p>Work your way through the sources in the two case studies. Make a note of any sources that provide evidence to support the explanations that historians have come up with.</p>
<p>This research table might help you. <a href="/education/civilwar/rtf/g4-researchtable.rtf" target="_blank">Open the table and print it out or save it to your computer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="p2">Part 2</h2>
<img src="/education/civilwar/g4/images/spy.gif" alt="A seventeenth century spy" class="rightfloat" />
<p>You are a spy working for a foreign king! The year is 1646. This king is interested in what is happening in England and Scotland. He wants to know why people are now supporting Charles.</p>
<p>Your challenge is to <strong>write a report</strong> for the foreign king. You are not rich or important, but you have a friend in the archives. This means you can look at important documents to get an idea of what people are thinking and writing.</p>
<p>You need to <strong>provide evidence</strong> to back up your answers. (To get that evidence, look at the sources in the two case studies. It will help if you complete Part 1 of this activity first.)</p>
