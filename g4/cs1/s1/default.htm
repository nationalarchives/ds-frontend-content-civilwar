<h2 id="p1">What is this source?</h2>
<p>These are sections from a letter by Nehemiah Wharton, a Parliamentary officer in the Civil War, written to George Willingham, a merchant.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more1').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<p id="more1" class="hidden">Wharton was a Puritan gentleman from the Midlands (near Leicester). His letters have proved very useful in giving us a picture of the impact of the Civil War on ordinary people.</p>
<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p>
<div class="horizline"></div>
<h2 id="p2">What’s the background to this source?</h2>
<p>This source comes from an early stage of the war – less than one month in and a month before the first big battle at Edgehill in October. As well as the big battles, there was a lot of smaller fights or skirmishes in the Civil War.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more2').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<p id="more2" class="hidden">Skirmishing meant small-scale mini-battles between units of Royalist and Parliamentary troops. Apart from fighting each other, the top priority of each army was to find food and supplies for the soldiers and horses. Each side often took anything they could find from local farms, villages and towns. They often took able-bodied men and forced them into their armies.</p>
<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p>
<div class="horizline"></div>
<h2 id="p3">It's worth knowing that...</h2>
<p>Wharton was a Puritan, a hard-line Protestant. During the war Puritans became increasingly powerful and important in the army.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more3').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<p id="more3" class="hidden">They and their men spent a lot of time at religious services, reading and discussing the Bible. As the war went on, many army officers and soldiers began to see themselves as chosen by God to protect the Protestant Church and Parliament from men like Archbishop Laud (who wanted to make changes to the church) and from possible plots by Catholics.</p>
<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p>
<div class="horizline"></div>
<h2 id="p4">Your turn: What can we learn from this source?</h2>
<ol>
<li>What happened to Justice Edmonds?</li>
<li>Is it possible to say whether this kind of thing happened a lot?</li>
<li>Do you think the countryman had much choice in becoming Wharton’s guide?</li>
<li>According to this source, what did Prince Rupert do?</li>
<li>Do you think this source gives a reliable view of the impact of the war?</li>
<li>What does this source tell you about Nehemiah Wharton?</li>
<li>Why did nothing happen on Sunday?</li>
<li>Study the source and the supporting notes. Why did so many soldiers begin to see themselves as ‘soldiers of god’?</li>
<li>How does this source help to explain why many people were supporting Charles in 1646?</li>
</ol>
