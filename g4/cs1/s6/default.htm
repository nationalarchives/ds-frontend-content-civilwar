<h2 id="p1">What is this source?</h2>
<p>This is a map of London showing the defences that Parliament built for the protection of the city.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more1').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<p id="more1" class="hidden">The key explains the different types of defences and the positions they were in. Redouts and bulwarks were basically small forts. A battery was a strong position that held one or more cannons. Breastwork meant steep mounds of earth or stone with fences to stop attacking forces.</p>
<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p>
<div class="horizline"></div>
<h2 id="p2">What's the background to this source?</h2>
<p>Parliament controlled London during the Civil War. This was a key factor in Parliament’s final victory. London had a large population and lots of wealth. This helped to pay for the war.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more2').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<p id="more2" class="hidden">Charles tried to capture London early in the war, but he was defeated. Parliament decided to strengthen the defences of London so that it did not lose possession of the city.</p>
<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p>
<div class="horizline"></div>
<h2 id="p3">It's worth knowing that...</h2>
<p>As a rule, the people of London supported Parliament against the king for most of the war. However, they paid a heavy price in taxes and seized goods and horses.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more3').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<p id="more3" class="hidden">London was a hotbed of radical people with new and extreme ideas. Before the Civil War there was strict censorship. It was dangerous to write about and print new ideas on religion or politics. During the Civil War the system of censorship broke down. Many new ideas began to spread. Some people became concerned about these new ideas. They began to think that if Charles returned as king, then he would crush these radicals and their new ideas.</p>

<h2 id="p4">Your turn: What can we learn from this source?</h2>
<ol>
<li>How does this source help us to see that London was important to Parliament?</li>
<li>How many defensive positions were there?</li>
<li>Do you think it was cheap to build and keep these defences in good condition? Who paid?</li>
<li>The defences were built to keep attackers out. Could they also have been used to control the population inside the city? Explain your answer.</li>
<li>How does this source help to explain why many people were supporting Charles in 1646?</li>
