<h2 id="p1">What is this source?</h2>
<p>This is an extract from a letter written by George Manley to his brother Thomas.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more1').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<p id="more1" class="hidden">George was in Cheshire and Thomas was in London.</p>

<h2 id="p2">What's the background to this source?</h2>
<p>The Civil War was virtually over. However, there were pockets of Royalist soldiers still fighting. Parliament and the army commanders were also very suspicious of areas of the country that had supported Charles, even if they were no longer fighting. As a result, they stationed large numbers of soldiers in these areas and forced the local people to pay for the soldiers through harsh taxes.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more2').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<p id="more2" class="hidden">Cheshire had tried to declare itself neutral during the Civil War, but Parliament had not allowed this. The city of Chester supported Charles I and so did much of the rest of the county. Parliament forces besieged Chester. Cheshire people had to suffer both Royalist and Parliament armies in their county.</p>
<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p>
<div class="horizline"></div>
<h2 id="p3">It's worth knowing that...</h2>
<p>Even areas that had not supported Charles had to pay heavy taxes to support the army. As discontent with taxes grew, army control gradually got tighter.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more3').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<div id="more3" class="hidden">
<p>From 1646 onwards the army became an increasingly powerful force. Taxes to pay for the army were far higher than they had ever been in the rule of Charles I. Parliamentâ€™s County Committees also controlled each county very closely.</p>

<ol>
<li>How bad were things in Cheshire in 1646?</li>
<li>What did Manley blame for the conditions?</li>
<li>How does this source help to explain why Charles gained support in 1646?</li>
