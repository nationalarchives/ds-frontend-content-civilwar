<h2 id="p1">What is this source?</h2>
<p>This is an order sent by Oliver Cromwell to Edward Dendy, Sergeant at Arms.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more1').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<p id="more1" class="hidden">This officer was responsible for law and order in the city of London.</p>

<div class="horizline"></div>
<h2 id="p2">What's the background to this source?</h2>
<p>The events in this document show why Cromwell often found himself torn in half. Cromwell thought people should be able to exchange ideas about politics and religion. He thought that this was a way for the population to become more religious and godly. On the other hand, he would not put up with attacks on his authority.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more2').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<p id="more2" class="hidden">In the years before the Civil Wars there was strict censorship in Britain. It was dangerous to come up with new ideas about religion or politics. It was even more dangerous to try to spread those ideas in pamphlets. During the Civil Wars those controls collapsed. New ideas were spread widely through cheap pamphlets run off on printing presses. By the time Cromwell took power these pamphlets were common and many of them attacked him.</p>
<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p>
<div class="horizline"></div>
<h2 id="p3">It's worth knowing that...</h2>
<p>There were so many different political and religious views in Cromwell’s time that it was difficult not to be criticised by someone.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more3').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<div id="more3" class="hidden">
<ul>
<li>Some religious hard-liners felt Cromwell did not do enough to make England a more godly place. Others felt Cromwell went too far!</li>
<li>Some wanted the monarchy restored. Most of the army was opposed to the return of the monarchy.</li>
<li>Most MPs were more worried than Cromwell by people questioning the way religion and politics was organised. They usually wanted harsher restrictions than Cromwell.</li>
<li>There were also pamphlets praising Cromwell.</li>
</ul>
