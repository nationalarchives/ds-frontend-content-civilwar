<h2 id="p1">What is this source?</h2>
<p>These are sections of a pamphlet published by Parliament. The Civil War was fought on the battlefields, but also through propaganda (in the form of pamphlets like this) which promoted the ideas of one side or the other.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more1').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<p id="more1" class="hidden">The new technology of printing made it possible to produce leaflets like this in large numbers.</p>
<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p>
<div class="horizline"></div>
<h2 id="p2">What's the background to this source?</h2>
<p>By 1642 relations between Charles and Parliament were a disaster.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more2').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<p id="more2" class="hidden">In January 1642 Charles lost patience with Parliament and tried to arrest five leading MPs and one Lord. This destroyed any trust that was left between the two sides. Charles left London and began to recruit an army. Parliament did the same.</p>
<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p>
<div class="horizline"></div>
<h2 id="p3">It's worth knowing that...</h2>
<p>The war officially began on 22 August 1642. Although we talk about Charles fighting Parliament, we should remember that the country was divided in many ways.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more3').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<p id="more3" class="hidden">In 1640 most MPs were united in criticising Charles. By 1642 some MPs were now on the king’s side as they felt that the opponents of Charles had gone too far. Many of Charles’s supporters stood by him out of loyalty rather than because they believed he was in the right. The great majority of people did not want war at all.</p>

<h2 id="p4">Your turn: What can we learn from this source?</h2>
<p>What was James trying to say? Try to identify parts of the speech showing that:</p>
<ol>
<li>According to this source, what had the king been doing?</li>
<li>According to this source, was the king to blame for the troubles affecting the country?</li>
<li>What actions was Parliament taking?</li>
<li>How did the source try to reassure people about Parliament’s actions?</li>
<li>Does this source give us any clues about why the kingdom went to war in 1642?</li>
