<h2 id="p1">What is this source?</h2>
<p>These are extracts from a report written by a gentleman called Thomas Wiseman to Sir John Penington. Penington was not in London at the time and wanted to be kept informed of what was happening.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more1').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<p id="more1" class="hidden">Wealthy and important people at the time were surprisingly well informed about events. There were many pamphlets and newspapers, as well as personal letters such as this one.</p>
<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p>
<div class="horizline"></div>
<h2 id="p2">What's the background to this source?</h2>
<p>By 1642 relations between Charles and Parliament were a disaster. In January 1642 Charles lost patience with Parliament and tried to arrest five leading MPs and one Lord (John Pym, John Hampden, Arthur Haselrigg, Denzel Hollis, William Strode and Lord Mandeville). This destroyed any trust that was left between the two sides after years of arguing.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more2').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<div id="more2" class="hidden">
<p>Clashes between Parliament and Charles leading up to this point included:</p>
<ul>
<li>In November 1641 they disagreed over who should control the army that was to be sent to Ireland to defeat the rebellion there.</li>
<li>In the same month Parliament passed the Grand Remonstrance criticising Charles’s policies.</li>
<li>By this stage Parliament was dominated by Charles’s opponents, led by John Pym and other Puritans. The Puritans opposed many aspects of Charles’s rule. They especially disliked the religious changes he brought in and that many people had been arrested and punished without a trial for opposing the king’s policies</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p>
<div class="horizline"></div>
<h2 id="p3">It's worth knowing that...</h2>
<p>One of the most important privileges of Parliament was that the king could not enter unless he was invited. This rule was to prevent the king sitting in Parliament and making MPs too nervous to say what they really thought. The attempt to arrest the MPs was a big step by Charles and convinced many MPs that he could not be trusted.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more3').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<p id="more3" class="hidden">Although we talk about Charles fighting Parliament, we should remember that not all MPs thought the same way. In 1640 most MPs were united in criticising Charles. By 1642 some MPs were now on the king’s side as they felt that Pym and the other opponents of Charles had gone too far. Many of Charles’s supporters stood by him out of loyalty, rather than because they believed he was in the right.</p>

<h2 id="p4">Your turn: What can we learn from this source?</h2>
<p>What was James trying to say? Try to identify parts of the speech showing that:</p>
<ol>
<li>What did Parliament do to the 12 bishops?</li>
<li>How did the king respond?</li>
<li>How did the crowd in London treat the king?</li>
<li>Was Thomas Wiseman impressed with the way the king handled the situation?</li>
<li>Was Wiseman’s sympathy with the king or with Parliament?</li>
<li>Do you get the impression that Wiseman was a reliable reporter of what happened?</li>
<li>What was the reaction to Charles’s attempt to arrest the MPs?</li>
<li>Does this source give us any clues about why the kingdom went to war in 1642?</li>
