<h2 id="p1">What is this source?</h2>
<p>This is part of a list of lords and officials who agreed to help Charles with his war effort against Parliament.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more1').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<p id="more1" class="hidden">It lists the various men who were prepared to help pay for horses for the king’s army. Horses were expensive to buy and feed. They were also essential for an effective army in the 1600s.</p>
<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p>
<div class="horizline"></div>
<h2 id="p2">What's the background to this source?</h2>
<p>By now relations between Charles and Parliament were a disaster. The war officially began on 22 August 1642, two months after this document was written.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more2').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<div id="more2" class="hidden">
<p>In the months leading up to war:</p>
<ul>
<li>In November 1641 king and Parliament clashed over who should control the army that was to be sent to Ireland.</li>
<li>In the same month Parliament passed the Grand Remonstrance criticising Charles’s policies.</li>
<li>In January 1642 Charles lost patience with Parliament and tried to arrest five leading MPs. This destroyed any trust that was left between the two sides.</li>
<li>Charles left London and began to recruit an army. Parliament did the same.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p>
<div class="horizline"></div>
<h2 id="p3">It's worth knowing that...</h2>
<p>Although we talk about Charles fighting Parliament, we should remember that the country was divided in many ways and the great majority did not want any war at all.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more3').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<p id="more3" class="hidden">By 1642 many MPs were against Charles. Some MPs were on Charles’s side because they felt that his opponents had gone too far. Many people supported Charles from loyalty, rather than because they believed he was in the right. Others, such as many of the men on this list, were convinced that the king’s cause was just.</p>

<h2 id="p4">Your turn: What can we learn from this source?</h2>
<p>What was James trying to say? Try to identify parts of the speech showing that:</p>
<ol>
<li>What types of men were listed on this document?</li>
<li>What have they agreed to do?</li>
<li>Why might this class of men have supported the king’s side?</li>
<li>According to this document, what were the king’s forces fighting to defend?</li>
<li>What does this source tell us about support for Charles I in 1642?</li>
<li>Does this source give us any clues about why the kingdom went to war in 1642?</li>
</ol>
