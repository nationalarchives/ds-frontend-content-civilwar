<h2 id="p1">What is this source?</h2>
<p>This is an extract from a proclamation (announcement or order) made by Charles at Newcastle on 14 May 1639 telling people in Scotland what he wanted them to do. He was trying to end rebellion in Scotland.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more1').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<p id="more1" class="hidden">Charles was king of England and Scotland. He wanted the English and the Scots to obey the same laws and he wanted the English and Scottish churches to be run the same way.</p>
<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p>
<div class="horizline"></div>
<h2 id="p2">What's the background to this source?</h2>
<p>Charles had been facing rebellion from his subjects in Scotland since 1637. The Scots refused to accept changes that Charles wanted to make to the church in Scotland.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more2').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<div id="more2" class="hidden">
<ul>
<li>Throughout the 1630s Charles and his Archbishop of Canterbury, William Laud, brought changes to the organisation of the church and also to the way people worshipped in church. Charles and Laud wanted to make the clergy, especially bishops, more important and powerful. Many Protestants in England and Scotland disliked these changes.</li>
<li>In 1637 Charles and Laud tried to force the Scots to accept a new prayer book. The Scots refused. (Religion was a very important issue to everyone in Scotland and England.)</li>
<li>In February 1638 the Scottish rebels formed themselves into a National Assembly. They signed a Covenant (agreement) banning the new prayer book.</li>
<li>The Covenanters (rebels who supported the Covenant) then went on to get rid of other changes brought in by Laud. In November they abolished bishops altogether.</li>
<li>Charles would not put up with this challenge to his authority. In November 1638 Charles raised an army and tried to crush the Scots, but he failed.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p>
<div class="horizline"></div>
<h2 id="p3">It's worth knowing that...</h2>
<p>Charles raised an army to fight the Scots in 1638. By May 1639, when this proclamation was made, Charles did not have enough money to continue the fight. This meant he had to try and reach an agreement with the Scottish rebels.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more3').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<p id="more3" class="hidden">Although Charles threatened to invade Scotland, he did not have a good enough army to do this. He did not have enough money for a large, well-equipped army. To get the money he needed, he would have to ask his Parliament. However, Charles did not like working with Parliament. He ruled without it from 1629-40. By the time he did call Parliament in 1640, many MPs were anxious to tell the king why they were unhappy about many aspects of his rule. Plus his conflict with the Scots dragged on until October 1640.</p>
