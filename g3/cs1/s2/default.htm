<h2 id="p1">What is this source?</h2>
<p>This is part of a letter written by Sir Richard Strode. He claimed that ship money (a kind of tax) and other taxes which Charles I raised in the 1630s were illegal.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more1').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<p id="more1" class="hidden">The letter is one of several documents in the State Papers that complain about ship money. Richard Strode was certainly not alone in his complaint. About 30% of the ship money charged was unpaid by the people.</p>
<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p>
<div class="horizline"></div>
<h2 id="p2">What's the background to this source?</h2>
<p>Charles I ruled from 1629-40 without calling Parliament. This period was known as the Personal Rule. Kings could not normally go this long without talking to Parliament. They usually ran short of money and new taxes had to be approved by Parliament. However, Charles hated working with MPs. He tried to get the money he needed by collecting taxes like ship money and tallage (a tax on landowners).</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more2').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<p id="more2" class="hidden">Ship money was supposed to be paid by counties near the coast. It was supposed to be paid in times of emergency to raise money for the navy to protect the country. However, from 1635 Charles I started collecting ship money every year. He also started collecting it from all counties, not just coastal counties.</p>
<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p>
<div class="horizline"></div>
<h2 id="p3">It's worth knowing that...</h2>
<p>There was a lot of opposition to ship money and other taxes. Richard Strode was a long-term opponent of the tax. He appears in government records in 1631, 1635, 1637 and 1639 complaining about ship money.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more3').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<div id="more3" class="hidden">
<p>Opponents of Charles’s taxes had three main complaints:</p>
<ul>
<li>They did not like paying the taxes!</li>
<li>They felt Charles was acting illegally by collecting taxes without the approval of Parliament.</li>
<li>They objected to the punishments and fines that were used against Charles’s opponents. In most cases, opponents were punished without a trial.</li>
</ul>

<div class="horizline"></div>
<h2 id="p4">Your turn: What can we learn from this source?</h2>
<ol>
<li>What happened to Richard Strode’s cow?</li>
<li>Why was Strode upset about it?</li>
<li>What is his attitude to being forced to pay the king ‘ship money’?</li>
<li>Do you think Strode was more concerned about his cow or about the king ignoring Parliament and acting outside the law?</li>
<li>Does this source give us any clues about why the kingdom went to war in 1642?</li>
</ol>
