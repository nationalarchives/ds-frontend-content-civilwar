<h1>Why did people go to war in 1642?</h1>
<h1 class="minorheading">Activity</h1>
<p>Why did people go to war in 1642? To tackle this question you will need to view the video clips of the civil war people. You will also find it helpful to study some of the original sources in case studies <a href="/education/civilwar/g3/cs1/">1</a> and <a href="/education/civilwar/g3/cs2/">2</a> and the background information in <a href="/education/civilwar/g3/key/">Key people &amp; events</a>.</p>

<p>Listen carefully to what each character says. </p>

<p>The words spoken by the characters in the video clips are reconstructions based on historical evidence. Your task is to decide how well we have done this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at the video clips. What points does each character make about the causes of the war?</li>
<li>Look at the evidence. How well are these points backed up by the original sources?</li>
</ul>
<p>You could use this research table to help you record your thoughts.</p>
<p><a href="/education/civilwar/rtf/g3-researchtable.rtf" target="_blank">Research table</a></p>

<h2>Your challenge</h2>

<p>Our video clips of civil war people are reconstructions using actors. Your task is to decide how well we have used the historical sources in this gallery to make these clips. </p>
