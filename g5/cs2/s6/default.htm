<h2 id="p1">What is this source?</h2>
<p>This is an extract from the memoirs of Edmund Ludlow. Ludlow was an MP and commander of the Parliamentary armies in the Civil War. He was a hard-line opponent of Charles I and signed his death warrant.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more1').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<p id="more1" class="hidden">Ludlow later clashed with Cromwell when Cromwell closed Parliament in 1653 and became Lord Protector. His memoirs were first published in the 1690s when the monarchy had been restored. For these two reasons the book is very hostile towards Cromwell.</p>

<div class="horizline"></div>
<h2 id="p2">What's the background to this source?</h2>
<p>The Instrument of Government, dated 15 December 1653, was England's first written constitution. It recorded the basic rules for a new kind of government. It gave power to an elected Lord Protector, advised by a council. Oliver Cromwell became Lord Protector the next day.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more2').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<div id="more2" class="hidden">
<ul>
<li>By 1653 Cromwell and other army commanders were frustrated. They had a vision of a more religious, godly country.</li>
<li>Most MPs in the Rump Parliament did not share this vision. The MPs were afraid of extreme political and religious groups and tried to crush them.</li>
<li>Cromwell wanted a more tolerant approach to these groups, as long as they did not cause trouble. Although he has a reputation as a religious fanatic, Cromwell was surprisingly relaxed about other faiths and religious groups.</li>
<li>The Rump Parliament also tried to reduce the size and power of the army because the nobles and gentry were fed up with paying taxes to keep it.</li>
<li>In 1653 Cromwell lost patience with the Rump and dismissed it. His supporters then made him Lord Protector.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p>
<div class="horizline"></div>
<h2 id="p3">It's worth knowing that...</h2>
<p>Cromwell became Lord Protector for life. He ruled until his death in 1658.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more3').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<div id="more3" class="hidden">
<p>The office of Lord Protector had many of the powers of a king. However, it was not hereditary. So when Cromwell died, none of his children automatically became ruler.</p>
