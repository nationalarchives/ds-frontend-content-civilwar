		<h1>Why did people go to war in 1642?</h1><h1 class='minorheading'>Case study 2: 1640-42 - Source 7</h1>
<p><b>Transcript</b></p>
<p class="sourcedescription">A pamphlet published by Parliament, 9 June 1642</p>
<p class="catalogueref">(Journals of the House of Commons, Vol. II, 1640-1642, p.618. Reprinted in 1803 by Order of the House of Commons)</p>
<p>Whereas it appears that the king, seduced by wicked Counsel, intends to make War against his Parliament; and, in pursuance thereof, under Pretence of a Guard for his person, hath actually begun to levy Forces, both of Horse and Foot; and sent out Summons, throughout the County of York, for the Calling together of Great Numbers; and some ill-affected Persons have been employed in other Parts to raise Troops, under the Colour of his Majesty's Service, making large Offers of Reward and Preferment to such as will come in: And that his Majesty doth with high and forcible Hand, protect and keep away Delinquents; not permitting them to make their Appearance, to answer such Affronts and Injuries as have been by them offered unto the Parliament: And those Messengers which have been sent from the Houses for them, have been abused, beaten and imprisoned; so as the Orders of Parliament which is the highest Court of Justice in this Realm, are not obeyed; &hellip;</p>

<p>1. They the said Lords and Commons do Declare, that whosoever shall bring in any Proportion of ready Money or Plate, or shall underwrite to furnish and maintain any Number of Horse, Horsemen, and Arms, for the Preservation of the publick Peace, and for the Defence of the King, and both Houses of Parliament, from force and Violence, and to uphold the Power and Privileges of Parliament according to his Protestation, it shall be held a good and acceptable Service to the Commonwealth, and a Testimony of his good Affection to the Protestant Religion, the Laws, Liberties , and Peace of this Kingdom, and to the Parliament and Privileges thereof.</p>
