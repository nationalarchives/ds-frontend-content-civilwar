		<h1>What kind of king was Charles I?</h1><h1 class='minorheading'>Case study 2: Charles I as a ruler - Source 4</h1>
<p><b>Simplified transcript</b></p>
<p class="sourcedescription">A petition against royal taxes from the town of Woodbridge in Suffolk, February 1627</p>

<p class="catalogueref">(Catalogue ref: SP 16/55/59)</p>
<p><strong>Source 4a</strong></p>
<p>Please consider the reasons which they humbly offer to your Lordships to excuse them not doing what was required of them, which are as follows</p>

<p>First&#8230; it is a poor county town &#8230;</p>

<p>Secondly, they have always been charged, with the rest of the county:</p>

<p>For the raising of money to build the late king&#8217;s building at Newmarket;</p>

<p>Towards the cost of paying for his Majesty&#8217;s household;</p>

<p>Towards the repairing and watching of beacons;</p>

<p>Towards the cost of gunpowder and watchmen and the wages of soldiers and officers in the troop for all five weeks training;</p>

<p>Towards the store of gunpowder, matches and bullets to be provided;</p>

<p>Towards the carts, providing several tools and horses for all of them;</p>

<p>Towards the cost of 3000 men to march into Kent upon any warning or danger;</p>

<p>And 5000 men upon the coast of Suffolk and 4000 men to march to Yarmouth on similar occasions;</p>

<p>And towards all other costs that the county is charged with.</p>
<p><strong>Source 4b</strong></p>
<p>Thirdly, there are only eight or nine ship owners in the town, and those are only coal ships. The townspeople said that the shipping belongs to Newcastle, London and other far-away places. And the ship owners of Woodbridge have been held back in the last two years because their ships have been taken into his Majesty&#8217;s service (where some of them still are), to the value of at least &#163;800, for which they have not yet received payment. &#8230;</p>

<p>Fourthly, the town consists of gentlemen and others who live on their land and craftsmen who have no connection to the sea. If a heavy charge is imposed on them, more than upon the countryside, they will be ready to abandon the town. Then the town will be in quite a bad state.</p>
