<p class="sourcedescription">Petition of Mary Baker to stop a County Committee in Kent taking her husbandâ€™s money, July 1643</p>
<p class="catalogueref">(Catalogue ref: SP 19/90)</p>
<p>[Extra explanations are in square brackets.]</p>

<p>The humble petition [request] of Mary Baker <br />
Wife of Sir John Baker, Baronet</p>

<p>Shows <br />
That in April the Committee in Kent seized the estate of Mary's husband in Kent, where his mansion house (about 40 miles from London) and all his land lies, to the value of about &pound;2000 &hellip;</p>

<p>Mary's husband is in very poor health, his whole estate has been seized, and so he cannot pay an extra 20th part [5%]. Yet a warrant was issued against Mary's husband to pay the rest. In truth Mary's husband is much in debt, and has at this time no means left to maintain himself, and his wife and children. &hellip;</p>
