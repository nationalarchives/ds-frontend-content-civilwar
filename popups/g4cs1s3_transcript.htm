<p class="sourcedescription">A report of discussions in Parliament concerning Cheshireâ€™s attempt to be neutral, 9 January 1643</p>
<p class="catalogueref">(Catalogue ref: SP 9/245/12)</p>
<p>A Perfect Diurnall of the passages in Parliament<br />
From 9 of January to the 16. <br />
More exactly collected then hath been heretofore,<br />
as ye shall find by the comparing, &amp;c.  &hellip;</p>

<p>Munday, the Parliament having taken into consideration certaine Articles dated 23. Decemb. last between some of the Deputy Lieutenants of the County of Chester well-affected to the peace of the Kingdome, and others who have declared themselves in sundry actions opposers of the proceedings of Parliament, and furtherers of the warre raised against them and of many injuries and oppressions lately exercised upon the good subjects inhabitants of that County, &hellip;<br />
Wherefore the Lords and Commons have made a Declaration to this effect viz. That none of the parties to that agreement had any authority by any act of theirs to binde that County to any such newtrality as is mentioned in that agreement, it being peculiar and proper power and Priviledge of Parliament.<br />
That this is prejudiciall and dangerous to the whole Kingdome that any County should withdraw themselves from the assistance of the rest to which they are bound by Law and severall orders and Declarations of Parliament. That it is very derogatory to the power and authority of Parliament that any private men should take upon them to suspend the execution of the Ordinance of the Militia, That many things in that agreement are very unequall and contrary to the nature of newtrality, and would be a great impediment to that good agreement betwixt his Majestie and his subjects which both houses do earnestly desire and endeavour: The Lords and Commons ordered that no such newtrality bee observed in that County which will secretly advantage the forces raised there in the neighbour Counties against the Parliament and no wayes benefit Cheshire, but most dangerous to them by keeping that County without any defensive forces,  &hellip;</p>
