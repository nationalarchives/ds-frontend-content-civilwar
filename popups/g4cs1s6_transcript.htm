  <p>[ 'Fortified' meant that Parliament strengthened and secured the city with fortifications. A
  fortification is a structure built for defence.</p>

  <p>Bulwarks and redoubts were types of fortifications - basically small forts.</p>

  <p>Hornwork was another type of fortification, usually built near a larger fort or building to
  create another layer of defence.</p>

  <p>Flanks were the sides.</p>

  <p>A battery was a strong position that held one or more cannons.</p>

  <p>Breastwork meant steep mounds of earth or stone with fences to stop attacking forces.</p>

  <p>A quadrant is an area shaped like one quarter of a circle but, with 4 bulwarks facing outwards
  as well, the quadrant fort at Vauxhall was really more like a star in shape.]</p>
