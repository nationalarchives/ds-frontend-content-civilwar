<p class="sourcedescription">Accounts of public money used in Ireland, with the portrait and symbols of Cromwell and the Commonwealth</p>
<p class="catalogueref">(Catalogue ref: SP 63/281)</p>
<p>[Extra explanations are in square brackets.]</p>
<p><em>[The portrait is Oliver Cromwell. The coat of arms at the top of the document is the arms of the Commonwealth, with the symbols of England, Ireland and Scotland. The coat of arms below Cromwell's picture is that of his brother, Henry. On the left side of the document there are a number of shields that represent those people named in the source]</em></p>
<p><strong>The account of all money received and paid for public use in Ireland, both what has been received from the Treasurers of War in England and what has come from within the Dominion of Ireland</strong></p>

<p>The money came from taxes, seizing property and rents, customs duty, and all sorts of methods and was <strong>taken</strong> out of the accounts of various departments and other persons responsible for public income (details later in this account). <strong>These</strong> accounts have been examined and approved by William Steele, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and various other Commissioners appointed by official letters given to them by his Highness, the Lord Protector. The official letters say: <strong>Oliver</strong>, by the Grace of God, Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland and their dominions, to our trusty and well-loved</p>
<ul>
<li>Henry Cromwell, Commander-in-Chief of all the forces in Ireland,</li>
<li>William Steele, Chancellor of Ireland,</li>
<li>Richard Pepys, Chief Justice of the Upper Bench,</li>
<li>Miles Corbett, Chief Baron of the Court of Exchequer,</li>
<li>Robert Goodwin, Mathew Tomlinson, William Bury, of the Council of Ireland,</li>
<li>Sir Gerrard Lowther, Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas,</li>
<li>Sir John Temple, Master of the Rolls,</li>
<li>Sir Robert Meredith, Chancellor of the Exchequer,</li>
<li>Sir Charles Coote, President of the province of Connaught,</li>
<li>Sir Hardresse Waller, Major-General of our foot soldiers in Ireland,</li>
<li>Sir Robert King, commissioner-general in Ireland,</li>
<li>William Basil, Attorney-General,</li>
<li>Arthur Hill, John Bridges, Robert Southwell, Robert Gorges and Edward Roberts, Auditors-General.</li>
</ul>
<p>Greetings. <strong>While</strong> we understand that great sums of money and large quantities of arms, ammunition and provisions of all sorts have been issued by several persons in Ireland, the accounts of these have not yet been fully worked out, because of the rebellions and war. This is a matter of great importance for the Commonwealth. <strong>Know you</strong> then that we set up, name, authorise, assign and appoint you to be our commissioners to do this. We give you (or any five or more of you) full power and authority to call before you</p>
<ul>
<li>the Lord Treasurer,</li>
<li>the Receiver General of our income in Ireland, the Treasurer at War,</li>
<li>the collectors and bookkeepers of our customs and duties in Ireland,</li>
<li>the Lieutenant-General,</li>
<li>the surveyor or clerk of our ports,</li>
<li>the commissioners of our stores and munitions and food,</li>
<li>various clerks, collectors and accountants that are, or were, or will be, trusted to receive or issue any public money, arms, ammunition or clothing of war, clothes, provisions, or any other things for which accounts ought to be made to us in Ireland.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should get them to show to you all accounts, declarations, books, certificates, orders and bills that concern these matters - anything that the accountants have and anything in the hands of any of our officers or ministers in Ireland. â€¦</p>
