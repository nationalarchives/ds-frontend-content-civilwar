<p class="sourcedescription">A report of discussions in Parliament concerning Cheshireâ€™s attempt to be neutral, 9 January 1643</p>
<p class="catalogueref">(Catalogue ref: SP 9/245/12)</p>
<p>[Extra explanations are in square brackets.]</p>

<p>A perfect daily journal of the events in Parliament from 9th of January to the 16th, more exactly collected then before, as you shall find by comparing, etc. &hellip;<br />
Monday. The Parliament has considered certain agreements, dated 23 December, between some of the Deputy Lieutenants of the County of Chester who are for the peace of the kingdom and others who have shown themselves through various actions to be against Parliament, and promoters of the war against Parliament and of many recent injuries and oppressions done to the good inhabitants of that county.  &hellip;<br />
So the Lords and Commons have made a declaration to this effect: That none of the parties to that agreement had any authority to bind that county to any such neutrality as is mentioned in that agreement, it being the proper power and right of Parliament alone.<br/>
It is dangerous to the whole kingdom that any one county should withdraw their help from the rest (to which they are bound by law and several orders and declarations of Parliament). It is very damaging to the power and authority of Parliament that any private men should take it upon themselves to suspend the Ordinance of the Militia [the order to raise troops for Parliament]. Many things in the agreement are opposite to the nature of neutrality. It would be a great barrier to an agreement between his Majesty and his subjects, which both Houses want very much and aim for. The Lords and Commons ordered that no neutrality be observed in that county because it will secretly advantage the forces raised in the neighbouring counties against the Parliament. It will not benefit Cheshire, but will be most dangerous to them by keeping that county without any defensive forces, &hellip;</p>
