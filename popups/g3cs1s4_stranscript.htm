<p class="sourcedescription">An announcement from Charles to the people of Scotland, May 1639</p>
<p class="catalogueref">(Catalogue ref: SP 45/10/225)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">By the King</p>

<p>Charles, by the grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith etc</p>

<p>To all our loving subjects, greetings. We have advanced with our army and our nobles and gentry of this kingdom. We intend to be mostly at Berwick, to give our good people of Scotland all justice in Parliament, as soon as the present disorderly actions of some there are quieted. We will come like a gracious King to declare our good will to them. But we find there is a barrier. This nation knows (that contrary to their claims) there is an intention to invade England. So to clear all doubts, that may breed worries in your minds, we repeat our just and real demand. If all civil obedience is effectively and quickly given to us, we do not intend to invade with any hostility. But if they raise any armed troops without our authority, and bring them down to within ten miles of the border of England, we shall then interpret that as an invasion of our kingdom. In that case, we command the general and senior officers of our army to proceed against them as rebels and invaders of England, and to the utmost of their power to set upon them and destroy them. In this they shall do a great service to both our honour and safety.</p>

<p>Given at our court at Newcastle, the 14th day of May, in the 15th year of our reign.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">God save the King.</p>
