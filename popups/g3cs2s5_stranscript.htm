<p class="sourcedescription">Report of rebellion in Ireland, November 1641</p>
<p class="catalogueref">(Catalogue ref: SP 16/485/58)</p>
<p>[Extra explanations are in square brackets.]</p>

<p>The treason [rebellion], being discovered, spread quickly throughout the north of Ireland, where the rebellion first began. In several places groups of the Catholics are up in arms, more than 10,000 men. This worries the poorer Protestants, and there is great fear whether they shall be able either to stop or resist them. Our Parliament directed my Lord of Leicester, Lord Lieutenant, and all other commanders here to quickly go there. It provided &pound;50,000 to carry along with them, which the city of London advanced for providing men and arms to secure that kingdom. The villains have shed some blood and committed great outrages and taken some castles and other strongholds. But if they had taken Dublin, various people have confessed upon the rack [under torture] that they would not have left a Protestant alive in the whole kingdom. But God in his Mercy has prevented that slaughter and has turned part of it upon the rebels. The traitors said that the harsh rule of Lord Strafford over them drove them to it and also the example set by the Scots [the Scottish rebellion]. By this means they hoped to gain privileges in their religion, which otherwise they never expected to have granted to them.</p>
