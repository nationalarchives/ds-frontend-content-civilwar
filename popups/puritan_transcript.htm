<p><b>Transcript</b></p>
<p>That’s ridiculous. We are decent law abiding Protestants. The King and Archbishop Laud are ignoring the law to suit themselves. They have made the Church more Catholic with all their changes. We want simple church services without any Catholic influences.  Charles has even married a Catholic! That woman, Henrietta Maria should never have become Queen. These papists should be banned from our country. We can’t trust Charles since he attempted to arrest five MPs in the House of Commons. John Pym is right, we certainly can’t rely on the King to control the army in order to deal with the Irish Rebellion.</p>
