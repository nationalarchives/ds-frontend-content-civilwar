<p class="sourcedescription">A legal complaint made by Sir Richard Strode about ‘ship money’, August 1639</p>
<p class="catalogueref">(Catalogue ref: SP 16/427/32)</p>
<p><strong>Source 2a</strong></p>
<p>Laws were passed in the reign of Edward I that no tax shall be taken by the king or his heirs without the good will and agreement of the Lords and Commons. In the reign of Edward III another law said that no one shall be forced to make any loans to the king against his will, &hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Source 2b</strong></p>
<p>Yet contrary to these laws and freedoms, one cow worth &pound;4 10 shillings, belonging to Sir Richard Strode of Plimton St Mary in the county of Kent, because of unlawful and unreasonable taxes made by Symon Hele, a guard, and others, was taken by Constable Thomas Row and sold for the king's service on 23rd March at Newingham to raise money for shipping, without the consent of Parliament.</p>
