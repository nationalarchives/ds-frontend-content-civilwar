<p><b>Simplified transcript</b></p>
<p class="sourcedescription">Extracts from a letter written by Parliament to Charles I, 13 January 1646</p>
<p class="catalogueref">(Catalogue ref. SP 16/513/10)</p>
<p>Concerning the personal treaty wanted by your Majesty, there has been so much innocent blood of your good subjects shed in this war by Your Majesty's commands and actions.<br /> ... The three kingdoms are brought near to utter ruin and destruction. We think that until satisfaction and security is given to both your kingdoms, Your Majesty's coming here is not convenient, nor agreed to by us. Nor can we see it a way to peace, that Your Majesty should come to your Parliament for a few days, with thoughts of leaving it again, and especially with intentions of returning to fighting against it. &hellip;</p>

<p>Against the freedom of the Parliaments, Your Majesty dictates in both your letters, with many keen words, that the peace of your kingdoms could only be achieved in the way that you propose. Please remember that in our last letter we said that ideas from both kingdoms were speedily to be sent to Your Majesty, which we think are the only way for getting a happy and well-grounded peace. Your Majesty's agreement to these ideas will be a good way to give satisfaction and security to your kingdoms. It will ensure a firm union between the two kingdoms, wanted by both. And it will settle religion and secure the peace of the kingdom of Scotland. &hellip;</p>
