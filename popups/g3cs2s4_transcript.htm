<p>&hellip;you your Estates your posterities lye all at the stake if such learned Gents as those whose lungs are well acquainted with such proceedings shall be started out against you if your frends, your Councell denied Accesse to you, if your professed Enemies admitted to witnesse agains you if every word intention circumstance of yours bee alledged as Treasonable, not because of a Statute but a consequence a construction of Lawe heaved up in a high Rhetorical Straine and a number of supposed probabilities. I leave it to your Lordships consideration to foresee what may be your issue of soe dangerous soe recent presidencies. These Gentlemen tell me they speake in defence of the Commonwealth against any Arbitrary Laws, give mee leave to say that I speake in defence of the Commonwealth against their Arbitary Treason, for if this latitude bee admitted what prejudice shall follow to the King to the Country if you and your posterity bee disabled by the same from the greatest affaires of the kingdoms.</p>
