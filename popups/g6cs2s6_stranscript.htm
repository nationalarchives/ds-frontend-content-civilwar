		<h1>What kind of ruler was Oliver Cromwell?</h1><h1 class='minorheading'>Case study 2: Cromwell in the eyes of others - Source 6</h1>
<p><b>Simplified transcript</b></p>
<p class="sourcedescription">Edmund Ludlow, on reactions to the death of Cromwell</p>
<p class="catalogueref">(By permission of <a href="/education/civilwar/credits/">Oxford University Press</a>: Firth (ed.), The Memoirs of Edmund Ludlow, Lieutenant-General of the Horse in the Army of the Commonwealth of England, 1625-1672, Vol. II, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1894, pp.45-6)</p>
<p>The death of Cromwell produced different effects in the nation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Those men who had shared with him in seizing power were very troubled.</li>
<li>The other parties rejoiced in it, each of them hoping that this change would prove good for their affairs.</li>
<li>The Commonwealth men were so generous as to believe that the soldiers (freed from serving the General, on which they were willing to blame their former behaviour) would now open their eyes and join with them, as the only means left to save themselves and the people.</li>
<li>The Royalists had great hopes that new divisions might arise, and give them an opportunity of advancing their man [Charles, son of Charles I], who had long been trying to unite all the corrupt interests of the nation to his party.</li>
<li>But neither the sense of their duty, nor the care for their own safety, nor the worries of being overcome by their enemy, could persuade the army to return to their proper station. So that having tasted power under the shadow of their late master, they decided against the return of the Parliament. ……The death of Cromwell produced different effects in the nation.</li>
