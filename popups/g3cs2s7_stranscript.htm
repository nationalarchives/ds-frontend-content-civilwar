		<h1>Why did people go to war in 1642?</h1><h1 class='minorheading'>Case study 2: 1640-42 - Source 7</h1>
<p><b>Simplified transcript</b></p>

<p class="sourcedescription">A pamphlet published by Parliament, 9 June 1642</p>
<p class="catalogueref">(Journals of the House of Commons, Vol. II, 1640-1642, p.618. Reprinted in 1803 by Order of the House of Commons)</p>
<p>It appears that the king, led on by wicked advice, intends to make war against his Parliament. In pursuit of this, while pretending to need his own guard, he has actually begun to call up forces, both on horse and foot. He sent out summons throughout the county of York, calling together great numbers. Some rebellious persons have been employed in other places to raise troops, under the colour of his Majesty's Service, making large offers of reward and promotion to those who will join. His Majesty, with a high and forceful hand, protects and keeps away criminals, not permitting them to appear to answer for such offences and injuries as they have offered to the Parliament. And those messengers, which have been sent from the Houses of Parliament, have been abused, beaten and imprisoned. So as the orders of Parliament, which is the highest court of justice in this realm, are not obeyed:  &hellip;</p>

<p>1. The Lords and Commons declare that whoever brings in any amount of ready money or items of silver and gold, or agrees to supply and maintain any number of horses, horsemen and arms, for the keeping of the public peace, and for the defence of the king and both Houses of Parliament from force and violence, and to uphold the power and rights of Parliament, shall do a good and acceptable service to the nation, and show evidence of his love for the Protestant religion, the laws, freedom and peace of this kingdom, and the Parliament and its rights.</p>
