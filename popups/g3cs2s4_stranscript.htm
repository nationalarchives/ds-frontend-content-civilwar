<p class="sourcedescription">Images from the trial of Thomas Wentworth, the Earl of Strafford</p>
<p class="catalogueref">(4a: John Rushworth, The Trial of Thomas Earl of Strafford. Published in London, 1680. 4b: SP 16/479/28, 4c: Wenceslaus Hollar D1317, 1641 <a href="/education/civilwar/credits/">National Portrait Gallery</a>)</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Wentworth, knight, Earl of Strafford, Viscount Wentworth, Lieutenant General of the Kingdom of Ireland, Lieutenant President of the Council in the North of England, Lieutenant of York, one of his Majesty’s Privy Council, and Knight of the Order of the Garter.</p>

<p>[The Privy Council was the monarch’s private council, made up of important men who advised the king. 
Being a knight of the Order of the Garter was the highest honour for an Englishman.]</p>

<p>You, your lands, your heirs, all are at stake</p>
<ul>
<li>if such educated gentlemen as these, who are familiar with such proceedings, start out against you,</li>
<li>if your friends and your lawyers are denied access to you,</li>
<li>if your enemies are allowed as witnesses against you,</li>
<li>if every word, intention and circumstance of yours is called treason, not because of a law, but because of a view of the law dragged up in an exaggerated way, and because of a number of supposed events.</li>
</ul>
<p>I leave it to your Lordships to foresee what may be the result of so dangerous recent legal decisions. These gentlemen tell me they speak in defence of the country against any high-handed laws. Give me leave to say that I speak in defence of the country against their high-handed treason. For if this is allowed to happen, what harm shall follow to the king, to the country, if you and your heirs are disqualified in the same way from the greatest affairs of the kingdoms.</p>
