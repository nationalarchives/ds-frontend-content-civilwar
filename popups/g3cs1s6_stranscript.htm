<p>[The letter]</p>

<p>May it please you to know that this enclosed note (with the time of receipt on it in my own handwriting) was delivered to me at Shrewsbury by Mr Thomas Jones, a young trainee lawyer living there. He received it that day from Tong, an alehouse keeper, who got it from his wife, who said she found it in a road leading towards Shrewsbury. The writer is not yet found, nor anyone who helped the writer. Now Sir, I am a Justice of the Peace in the town and county of Shropshire. Seeing towards the end of His Majesty's announcement against the Scots that things of this nature are to be sent to one of His Majesty's secretaries, according to my duty, I have sent it to you. God willing, I will do my best to discover the author. &hellip;</p>

<p>[The note]</p>
<p>Lord bless this our potato pie</p>
<p>And pull out all the Bishop's eyes</p>
<p>And now we are of great might</p>
<p>We mean to make you a bloody fight</p>
