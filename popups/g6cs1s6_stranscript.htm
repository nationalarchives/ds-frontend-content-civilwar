		<h1>What kind of ruler was Oliver Cromwell?</h1><h1 class='minorheading'>Case study 1: Cromwell in his own words - Source 6</h1>
<p><b>Simplified transcript</b></p>
<p class="sourcedescription">Cromwell’s thoughts about his job, 13 April 1657</p>
<p class="catalogueref">(W.C. Abbott (ed.), The writings and speeches of Oliver Cromwell, Vol. III, p. 470. Published by <a href="/education/civilwar/credits/">Harvard University Press</a>, Cambridge, 1947)</p>
<p>I am a man standing in the job I am in - a job I took not so much because of the hope of doing any good, but because of wanting to prevent mischief and evil, which I saw was coming to the nation. I saw we were running headlong into confusion and disorder, and would come to bloodshed. I agreed to those that wanted me to take the job that I now have [Lord Protector]. ……</p>
<p>And so I am not arguing for one name compared with another, and so have nothing to say to any arguments that prefer either Kingship or Protectorship. I should think that almost any name would be better than my name. I would think any person fitter than I am for such business, and that’s not a compliment, God knows it! ……</p>
<p>as far as I can, I am ready to serve, not as a king, but as an officer [of the law]. For truly, as before God, I have often thought that I could not say what my business or job was, except by comparing it with a good officer keeping the peace of the community. And truly, during the troubles that I have been through, it has made me content and happy that you have peace.</p>
