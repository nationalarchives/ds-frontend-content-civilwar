  <p>[Extra explanations are in square brackets.]</p>

  <p>It is ordered by the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament, for the defence of the king
  and Parliament and the true Protestant religion and the laws and freedoms of the kingdom, that an
  army immediately be raised, made up of:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>6600 men on horse, to be put into 11 regiments;</li>

    <li>And 1000 men who can fight on foot or on horse, to be put into 10 companies;</li>

    <li>And 14,400 foot soldiers, to be put into 12 regiments, each foot regiment to be made up of
    1200, and to be put into 10 companies.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This army shall be paid according to the arrangement to be made by both Houses of Parliament,
  and shall be under the immediate command of Sir Thomas Fairfax, Knight, &hellip;</p>

  <p>And it is further ordered by the Lords and Commons, that from the 1st of February 1644, the
  sums of money mentioned below shall be taxed and paid for the payment of the army and related
  costs in the following way.</p>

  <p>That is: There shall be a monthly charge, until the 1st of December next, if the war goes on
  so long, upon:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The city of London and the county of Middlesex - &pound;8059 and 15 shillings</li>

  </ul>

  <p>And so that these sums of money may be taxed and paid, it is further ordered by the Lords and
  Commons that the Committees appointed for the cities, counties and places mentioned shall meet
  together (at some convenient place in each of the cities, counties and places) within eight days
  of this order being published. Afterwards, at least seven of them shall meet (at such places as
  they think fit) at least twice every week, to quickly put this order into action; &hellip;</p>

  <p>And at once the Committees are authorised and required to appoint whatever number of people
  they think fit within their areas to be assessors of the rates. These people are authorised and
  required to assess every person within their area who has any land or money, [to pay] according
  to the rates mentioned in this order.</p>

  <p>[In old money: 4 farthings equalled one penny, 12 pence equalled one shilling and 20 shillings
  equalled &pound;1.]</p>
