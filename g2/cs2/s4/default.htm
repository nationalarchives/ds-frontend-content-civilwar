<h2 id="p1">What is this source?</h2>
<p>This is a petition or request from the people of Woodbridge in 1627. They were explaining to the government why they had not supplied the information they were asked for. They wanted to get out of paying a tax called ‘ship money’.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more1').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<p id="more1" class="hidden">The government had asked for information about shipping in Woodbridge. Once the government had all the information, the town would be told how much tax it had to pay. Ship money was a tax which was usually paid by coastal towns to help pay for the navy. It was a tax that Charles could collect without consulting Parliament.</p>
<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p>
<div class="horizline"></div>
<h2 id="p2">What's the background to this source?</h2>
<p>There were several different types of taxes that towns had to pay. As well as ship money, other taxes took the form of paying for the king’s soldiers. This might be cash for the wages, ships to transport them, equipment or food for the troops. Plus in the 1600s the government did not have police forces, traffic wardens and all the other officials it has today. Instead people in towns like Woodbridge had to carry out many different jobs for the king.</p>
<ul>
<li>They had to raise money for a royal building.</li>
<li>There was no full time army with bases and barracks. Soldiers were recruited and trained in local areas. The local people had to find food and shelter for these soldiers in their homes, farms and barns.</li>
<li>They paid for powder and matches. These were essential for an army in the 1600s. Without them the guns did not work.</li>
<li>They kept the beacons. These were alarm signals. If attackers were spotted coming in from the sea, a beacon would be set on fire. The next beacon further away would see the first beacon and send a signal, and so on. This would raise the alarm.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more2').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<p id="more2" class="hidden">Most of the nobles loved art, architecture and fine things. As king, Charles was keen to have the finest things of all. Magnificent buildings like the Banqueting House and the Palace of Whitehall did impress people. Charles also insisted on strict rules of behaviour at court. People could only talk to him at certain times. His rules were designed to remind people that he was the king.</p>
<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p>
<div class="horizline"></div>
<h2 id="p3">It's worth knowing that...</h2>
<p>Most monarchs in the 1600s were short of money. Charles I was no exception. Charles was facing a war against Spain in 1626. He was recruiting and training soldiers and sailors. He needed money to feed, pay and equip them.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="morelink" onclick="document.getElementById('more3').style.display='block'; this.style.display='none'; return false;">More</a></p>
<p id="more3" class="hidden">Monarchs usually called Parliaments when they needed money for wars, but Charles did not like dealing with Parliament. His father (James I) had always understood that running the country meant some give and take. Charles disliked the idea of making deals and compromising. He simply wanted people to do what he told them.</p>
<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p>
<div class="horizline"></div>
<h2 id="p4">Your turn: What does this source tell us?</h2>
<ol>
<li>The petition set out five reasons why Woodbridge would struggle to pay ship money. What were they?</li>
<li>Which reasons do you find most convincing?</li>
<li>What does this source tell us about what people had to pay for in towns like Woodbridge?</li>
<li>According to this source, had Charles been paying his bills?</li>
<li>Do you get the impression that the people of Woodbridge have a good case or do you think they are just dodging taxes?</li>
