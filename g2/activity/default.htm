<p>SHHHHH! You are a spy!</p>
<p>You are working for a foreign king in the late 1620s. This king is actually quite friendly towards England. He is interested in making an alliance with Charles I. He wants to check out if Charles is an effective ruler.</p>
<p>Your challenge is to <strong>write a report</strong> for the foreign king. You are not rich or important, but you have a friend in the archives. This means you can look at important documents to get an idea of how well Charles is ruling. The foreign king particularly wants answers to these questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does Charles rule in the same way as the rulers who came before him?</li>
<li>How would you describe Charles's character?</li>
<li>What do you think is going to happen in the next few years – will Charles’s rule mean steady or difficult times ahead?</li>
<li>How would you describe relations between Charles and the political nation? Remember: The political nation means the top people in the country – the lords, the local gentry, the wealthy merchants. They are important because they collect the taxes. They make sure the laws are obeyed. When the king needs an army, they help him to recruit and pay for it. Many of them also advise the king as MPs. If Charles doesn't get on with these men, he will have a hard time ruling his kingdoms.</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to <strong>provide evidence</strong> to back up your answers. To get that evidence, look at the sources in Gallery 2: What kind of a king was Charles I?</p>
<p>Use this <a href="/education/civilwar/rtf/g2-report.rtf" target="_blank">report outline</a> to get you started.</p>

<h2 id="p2">Part 2</h2>
<p>Here are some comments a historian made about Charles I.</p>
<blockquote>… Charles lacked many of the personal qualities needed by an early modern ruler. He had little skill in the art of man-management which was crucial when so much depended on the king's relations with leading politicians and noblemen. …</blockquote>
<blockquote>… he was never a confident judge of human character and tended either to go overboard in his affection for those he felt were serving him loyally, like Buckingham, or to form strong dislikes which made it very hard for him to work with certain politicians. …</blockquote>
<blockquote>… Another shortcoming … was his unwillingness to bargain and negotiate. …</blockquote>
